1.) Develop a Node.JS api that allows a client app to:  Obtain the full directory listing of a given directory path on the local filesystem. Include the full path, file size and attribute information in the result and cater for a large directory size ( at least 100 000).  Make sure the application is containerized and can run on any system. You can use REST or Graphql. We are a Graphql company, but if you donâ€™t know it yet then I would suggest you use what you know best.  2.) Build a Angular 6 client and can call the api and display the results. It does not have to be fancy, you can use frameworks like bootstrap to display the data. ( If you do not know Angular that is fine. The documentation is really good and should give you the basics of what you want done really quick )  3.) Try and stay away from imperative style coding as much as possible. Stream is you partner.
